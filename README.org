* Program Analysis Note

** Reading Notes

I have included my notes under /note/ folder. My interpretation might be wrong so isseus and PR are welcome.

** Framework

Here are some frameworks for program analysis. I strongly recommend you to
implement algorithms on them.

- =LLVM=: the =Clang Static Analyzer= is a awesome tool to analyze C/C++
  from AST level. And =LLVM Pass= provides a more low-level IR to
  analyze.
- =Soot=: tools for Java program anlysis and optimization
- =BAP=: Binary Analysis Platform. Written in OCaml. We can inspect
  customize IR =BIL= to analyze different binary.
- =Angr=: Binary Analysis and Symbolic Exectuion

** Project

- [[https://github.com/facebook/infer][Infer]]: Source code static
  analysis based on OCaml
  
- BAP based
  - [[https://github.com/fkie-cad/cwe_checker][CWE-Checker]]: Binary
    analysis based on BAP
  - [[https://github.com/draperlaboratory/cbat_tools][CBAT TOOLS]]: This
    project implements VSA and WP on BAP
  - Several papers related to BAP implementation:

** Intro

Normally, the basic parts include dataflow analysis frameword (reaching
definition, interval analysis, ...), pointer analysis (andreson and
steensgaard), and abstract interpretation (sign analysis). You are also
encouraged to learn discrete math to understand the notations in text
books.

** Courses

- Static Analysis:

  - [[https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse501/15sp/][UW CSE
    501]]: Personally recommend, the contents are more compacted.
  - [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/courses/17-355-19sp/][CMU
    CS17-355]]: Some slides are missing. And the contents focus on
    security stuff more. Recommend to use notes here and slides from UW
  - https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/ementa/
  - [[http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~weile/cs513x/][IOWA CS513X]]: The topic
    is about staitc analysis but slighlty more depth.
  - [[http://web.mit.edu/16.399/www/#schedule][MIT 16.399]]: Abstract
    Interpretation, in a more math way.

- Program Synthesis and Model Checking

  - [[https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599a2/15wi/][UW
    CSE599]]: Advanced Computer-Aided Reasoning for Software
  - [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15414/schedule.html][CMU CS15-414]]: Model
    Checking
  - [[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-820-fundamentals-of-program-analysis-fall-2015/][MIT 6.820]]: Focused on abstract interpreter and model checking.

- SMT:

  - [[https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse507/][UW CSE 507]]:
    SMT solver and apllications
  - [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/15816-f19/][CMU 15816]]: Automated
    Reasoning and Satisfiability

- Books:

  - [[https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/spa.pdf][SPA Book]]: Personally
    recommend. This book is static analysis oriented. It also provied a
    toy language analyszer. The psedu-code and syntax are better the
    PPA.
  - Principle of Program Analysis: Old school book. The syntax is
    abstract. Might be too hard to understand.
